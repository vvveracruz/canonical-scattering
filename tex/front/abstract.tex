The aim of this project is to better understand the scattering of acoustic waves around different objects. The starting point for this are the Navier-Stokes equations and a simplified model of acoustic wave motion in air.

The model of wave motion relies on assumptions about the nature of fluid flows, namely, that air is a barotropic, adiabatic ideal gas. These are explained in some detail in the development of the theory.

We use perturbation theory to arrive at the Linear Wave Equation from the Navier-Stokes equations. We then use this wave equation to derive the Helmholtz equation.

These equations are used to investigate our first problem; scattering of acoustic waves around a cylinder. There were two primary aims for this project: firstly, to find an expression for the resulting field and, secondly, to plot this field using Python. The plotting of the actual wave field is still pending.
