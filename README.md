# Solving canonical scattering problems

This is the repository for my third year Mathematics project at the University of Manchester: Canonical Scattering Problems. It is concerned with the behaviour of acoustic waves around a cylinder.

## Getting Started

To run the plotter tool only the `py` folder is required. The `tex` folder is for version control of my report files.
