# Solving canonical scattering problems

This is the repository for my third year Mathematics project at the University of Manchester: Canonical Scattering Problems. It is concerned with the behaviour of acoustic waves around a cylinder.

## Getting Started

To run the plotter tool only the `py` folder is required. The `tex` folder contains the report files.

The plotter tool can be run from the command line. The type of plot will be specified by the constrains in the file `data.txt`. You can choose betwee two types of boundary conditions: Neumann and Dirichlet by changing the value of `boundary_type`.
